Example of queries I've built

1.Add meta data to existing title set
2.Performing No Reorder - automated process created (kicked off weekly) to update all titles in an assigned status to be removed from the automatic reorder process. Prior to automated process, each buyer would need to review titles as part of their monthly tasks and re-assign
3.Vendor scorecard - built to provide purchasing departments with a single report for 12 month rolling details across all vendors
4.Outside vendor receipts - understanding of where receiving information is logged and the various flags applied
5.MAP Pricing Query - developed because there was no system in place to mass collect MAP pricing for purchasing teams
6.Market Basket Analysis - developed as a stripped down version of what was available from WM system, to allow better understanding of market basket for future promotional opportunities
7. 4 WOS by store by item - built to provide tool for purchasing agent in manual replenishment process
